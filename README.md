# XCAPITAL Project - Angular

This project is a test created for a job application. The goal was to build a website using Angular. Although responsiveness was not a requirement, efforts were made to make the site as responsive as possible. However, the ideal resolution to view the design correctly is above 1640px.

- **Responsiveness**: Efforts have been made to make the site responsive, although it was not a requirement.
- **Optimized Design**: The best visual experience is obtained on screens with a resolution higher than 1640px.
- **Reusable Components**: Reusable components have been created to facilitate maintainability and scalability.
- **SCSS Styles**: SCSS has been used for style management.
